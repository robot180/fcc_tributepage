                    A Fateful Vision & Defending Hoth - 3 ABY
                    After just barely surviving a freak accident in the freezing cold, Luke experienced a Force vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to find Yoda.
                    Before he was able to act on it, and not long after Han saved his life once again, Luke went into action to help the Rebels defend themselves from an assault on their formerly secret base on Hoth. This is where audiences saw the iconic AT-ATs for the very first time.

                    Acting on his visions from Hoth, Luke made his way over to Dagobah.
                    It doesn''t take him long to find what he''s looking for: Grand Master Yoda.
                    The little green legend began to train the chosen one. However, the duo''s training is cut short by some worrying visions.

                    In doing so, Luke fell right into Darth Vader''s trap. While it doesn''t go exactly how the Sith had hoped, the young Jedi-to-be loses a hand and learns that the big bad is his father.

                    Following the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Luke Skywalker assembled a group of allies to save Han Solo, who was previously stuck in carbonite, from the treacherous gangster Jabba the Hut on Tatooine.
                    
                    After a few failed attempts at communication, everyone is sentenced to death by Sarlaac pit. It doesn''t go well for Jabba and his crew, as Luke and company escape after blowing up the crime bosses' sand barge.

                    After confronting a Force ghost version of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke learned that his secret sibling was none other than Leia herself.

                    The Emperor fried Luke with force lighting, leading Darth Vader to betray his former master by hurling him down a reactor shaft.
